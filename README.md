# Plotting_with_Matplotlib

In this project, I have used ride sharing data to gain meaningful insight into a ride sharing company. 
I used Pandas and MatPlotlib to create Bubble Plots and Pie Charts that showcase the relationships
between key variables. 

The Bubble Plots showcase:
* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

The Pie Charts showcase:
* % of Total Fares by City Type
* % of Total Rides by City Type
* % of Total Drivers by City Type
